Feature: List view

  As a MAdeK user
  I want to see resources in a list view
  so that I can see a lot of metadata at one glance
  instead of having to click on every resource

  Background: Load the example data and personas
    Given I have set up the world a little
      And personas are loaded
      And I am "Normin"

  @javascript
  Scenario: What I see when I am on a list view
    Given I see a list of resources
    When I switch to the list view
    Then each resource is represented as one row of data
    And for each resource I see meta data from the "core" context
    And for each resource I see a thumbnail image if it is available
    And for each resource I see an icon if no thumbnail is available
  
  @javascript
  Scenario: Actions available for a resource
    When I see a resource in a list view
    Then the following actions are available for this resource:
    | action                                       |
    | Editieren                                    |
    | Als Favorit merken                           |
    | Zugriffsberechtigungen lesen/bearbeiten      |
    | Zu Set hinzufügen/entfernen                  |
    | Erkunden nach vergleichbaren Medieneinträgen |
    | Löschen                                      |
    | Zur Auswahl hinzufügen/entfernen             |
