Feature: Filtering by permissions

  As a MAdeK user
  I want to be able to filter resources by permissions after a search
  So that I can see all the resources that are owned by a specific person
  And so that I can see which resources I have specific permissions for (as 
  covered by the permissions presets)


  Scenario: Filtering by permission presets
    Given there are the following permission presets:
    | name       | view | edit  | download |
    | Viewer     | true | false | false    |
    | Downloader | true | false | true     |
    | Editor     | true | true  | false    |
    And there are various resources on which I have permissions matching some of those permission presets
    When those resources are shown in search results
    And I filter by permission preset "Downloader"
    Then I see only those resources where I have permissions matching the preset "Downloader"
    When I filter by permission preset "Viewer"
    Then I see only those resources where I have permissions matching the preset "Viewer"
    When I filter by permission preset "Editor"
    Then I see only those resources where I have permissions matching the preset "Editor"
    

  Scenario: Filtering by owner
    Given there are 20 media entries owned by 10 different owners
    When those entries appear in search results
    Then I can filter so that I see only the media entries by each of those owners

  Scenario: Filtering by group
    Given there are 20 media entries that belong to 3 different groups
    When those entries appear in search results
    Then I can filter so that I see only the media entries that have some permissions relating to each of those groups
